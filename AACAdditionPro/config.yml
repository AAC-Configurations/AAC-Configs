### ESP
# This module uses advanced mathematics to determine if players can see each other.
# It also thinks of the 3rd person camera modes and uses accurate hitbox-models.
# If the players cannot see each other several actions will be taken to hide information on packet-level.
#
# MAIN FUNCTIONS:
# - Sneaking-Hider:  A sneaking player who cannot be directly seen by another player will be completely hidden from
#                    the second player. (This will make esp / tracers / radar / similar useless if the player who
#                    should be shown is sneaking)
#
# - Equipment-Hider: If a player cannot be directly seen by another player his equipment (hand, armour) will be hidden
#                    from the observer. (This will make the life of cheaters harder as they cannot properly estimate
#                    the combat strength of a player)
